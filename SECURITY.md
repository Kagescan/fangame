# Security Policy

Since the fangame is a non-profit project (just as every Kagescan-related projects), we don't provide any bug bounty nor reward policy.  

## Supported Versions

The code inside the master branch. Production and beta builds may not be fixed, this will depends on the vulnerability severity.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact me with my public github e-mail or the discord link in my user profile (https://github.com/LoganTann).

We will do our best to answer you as soon as possible, generally unders 24 business hours.  
Still, the fangame is made on our free time so we cannot guarantee a quick vulnerability fix, but we will keep you informed as much as possible.
