RETAINING'S MEMORY - LANGAGE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================

In contrary of most visual novel games, Retaining's Memory wasn't made with Renpy.  
Renpy is a really grat project, I have no objections. But I wanted to add "My touch" : add an attractive side with mini-game between some parts of the story ! I wanted to customize the standart visual novel style.

As i said before, I didn't used Renpy... I literraly made my own visual novel engine !  
I agree this isn't as perfect as most other engines, but i wanted to add the DIY/ludic side in this project.

Then there is the documentation of this engine !

The scripting/parsing side of the engine is inside the script.cpp file, and the helpers are mostly inside game.cpp .
Notice that this game is fisrtly french. I intent to translate it afer I will made a release version.
