# kagepro2
The Kagerou Project Fangame V2  
This is a remake of a fangame that I made with my community.The version 1 was written in Python but in this remake, the entire code is in C++.

### status
**The game inside this branch is not finished : even if the code is inside the master branch, you can't play. You can just try some features.**  
Because of that, there is not builds of this code.

I'm working with a new syntax

### dependancies
You just need the SFML library. [http://sfml-dev.org].  Open AL could be a dependency.


### compiling - download binairies
This project is in developement : actually, **you can't play** ! You can just try "Features"

Written in linux (Xubuntu 18.04 LTS), not tested in Windows.
Be careful with current directory, open the executable using file explorer if you don't need the terminal.

I created this github just for save my code and use git, not for share it : if you want to try the code, you need to edit the makefile by yourself because it could not work with your computer.

### project main page
the main page [http://kagescan.legtux.org/fangame] is outaded, I will update it soon.
