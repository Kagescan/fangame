# kagepro2
The Kagerou Project Fangame V2
This is a remake of a faname that I made with my community.The version 1 was written in Python but in this remake, the entire code is in C++.

### status
**Please watch the branch newEngine !!
I'll update master branch only where I'll finish a playable alpha version !**

### dependancies
You just need the SFML librairy. [http://sfml-dev.org]  Open AL is also recommanded.


### compiling - download binairies
This project is in developement : actually, **you can't play** ! You can just test "Features"
Written in linux (Xubuntu 16.04 LTS),not tested in Windows.
Be careful with current directory, open the executable using file explorer if you don't need the terminal.
*I created this github just for save my code and use git, not for share it !*
Sooo just edit the makefile as you need and use `make` to compile the code !!
Note : the makefile of the branch newEngine is adapted for linux and windows.


### project main page
the main page [http://kagescan.legtux.org/fangame] is outaded, I will update soon.
