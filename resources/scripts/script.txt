/*
This is a test for the new synthax of the kagerou project fangame novel engine.
The kagescan game is a bit different than other novel engines, because there is a map and label whill be executed only if the player interacts with the map.
Like pokemon ! but in a event, it is a visual novel.
The new synthax is based of the ren'py scripts.
I will implement soon condictions (if else statements and vars but not lopp !)
